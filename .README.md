# School readers import

SRD stands for School Readers Data standard (schema).

The `srd.xsd` contains definition of XSD to be used for basic validation of readers data.

There are various tools (also online) that validate XML against XSD. One way is to use Netbeans IDE for that.

## Netbeans validation

1. Add attributes to a root element of a SRD file (so in DATA tag):
```
xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="srd.xsd"
```

2. Open the SRD in Netbeans.

3. Run validation (via shortcut: ALT+SHIFT+F9; or choose from menu).
